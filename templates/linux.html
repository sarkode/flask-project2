<p><i>Editing text in linux programing</i></p>
<p>Open the pico editor.

Type some text! Say hello, write your name, where you come from, what you like to do in your spare time. Write two paragraphs about yourself.

At the bottom of the screen, you'll see all the commands you can use. Sometimes you'll see ^ - this just means ctrl. So for example, ^O just means ctrl+o.
Use the WriteOut command to save your work (name the file with your first name), then the Exit command to quit pico. You'll be right back at the command prompt.
My file is called eric. What happens when I type cat sam in the command prompt? Try that with the name of your file. Use the manpage for cat to figure out what's happening.
What happens when I type less eric? What's less? (Type q to escape!). Do you recognise less? It's how manpages are shown on the screen!
What happens when I type head -1 eric? What about tail -1 eric?</p>
